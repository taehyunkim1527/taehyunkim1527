    <h3>Research Projects</h3>
      <b>CoDDL</b>
      <ul>
        CoDDL is a job coordinator on a multi-tenant cluster specialized for distributed deep learning. 
        In order to utilize the resources efficiently even if new jobs starts and existing jobs finish 
        randomly, we should re-distribute the GPUs to jobs whenever necessary. In addition to frequent 
        re-distribution, it is important to take account of lengths and throughput scalability of jobs 
        that varies from model to model. CoDDL designs a scheduling algorithm to improve the job completion 
        time and fairness with above considerations and implements system supports for frequent 
        re-distribution. We have built a stable version of CoDDL. This is an on-going project.

      <b>Efficient Data Pipeline for Graph Neural Network</b>
      <ul>
        Recently, large graph data has more than billions of nodes and hundreds of billions of edges. 
        However, GNN frameworks should load the entire graph topology on local memory for high throughput, 
        and therefore we can’t run a model if our memory can’t afford it. Some frameworks by-paths this 
        challenge by sampling the graph or use networked shared memory over multiple servers but they can 
        be less accurate or a waste of resources. I’m conducting a research on designing a graph 
        compression algorithm and efficient pipelining to make GNN training on a large graph more efficient.
        This is an on-going project.
