    <h3>Research Projects</h3>
    CoDDL: Dynamic Resource Sharing for Distributed Deep Learning on the Multi-tenant Cluster May 2017–
    CoDDL is a job coordinator on a multi-tenant cluster specialized for distributed deep learning. 
    It supports auto-parallelization to run each deep learning job on multiple GPUs and 
    fast re-adjustment of the number of GPUs for a job to let it yield or add GPUs in runtime. 
    Therefore, even if some jobs come in and out frequently, schedulers can maintain high utilization 
    of cluster resources by calculating the best allocation consistently. 
    We have built a stable version of CoDDL. This is an on-going project.

    Efficient Data Pipeline for Graph Neural Network Dec 2019–
    Recent large graph data structure has more than billions of nodes and hundreds of billions of edges.
    Therefore, GNN frameworks can’t load the entire graph topology on local memory and it harms 
    the training throughput. Some frameworks by-paths this challenge by sampling the graph or 
    use networked shared memory over multiple servers but they can be less accurate or 
    a waste of resources. I’m conducting research on designing a graph compression algorithm and 
    efficient pipelining to make GNN training on a large graph more efficient. 
    This is an on-going project.
